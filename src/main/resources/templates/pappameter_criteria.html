                <P class="m-text">
                    Movie and television reviews in the Tomatometer® come from publications (e.g., newspapers,
                    magazines,
                    websites, etc.) or individual critics that have been selected by the Rotten Tomatoes® staff. The
                    criteria for inclusion for both publications and critics are separated across three divisions:
                    print,
                    broadcast, and online, each with its own criteria for Tomatometer inclusion, more fully described
                    below.
                    In many cases, for a variety of reasons, we may also include publications or critics that do not
                    meet
                    the below criteria, and may assign them to the below categories, if we feel that their inclusion
                    will
                    benefit the relevance and utility of the Tomatometer.
                </P>

                <h3>SOURCE APPROVAL</h3>

                <div class="m-text">
                    <p>Print publications must achieve and maintain status as one of the following:</p>

                    <ul class="ui list">
                        <div class="item">A top 100 daily US newspaper</div>
                        <div class="item"> A top 100 weekly US newspaper</div>
                        <div class="item"> A top 100 magazine</div>
                        <div class="item"> A top 100 weekly US newspaper</div>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Sources used to determine national publication ranks include the Audit Bureau of Circulations,
                        The Magazine Publishers of America, and the Association of Alternative Weeklies. Applications
                        for international publications will be made on a case-by-case basis, with input from local
                        Rotten Tomatoes editors when applicable.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Broadcast outlets must achieve and maintain status as a national TV or radio outlet (either via
                        syndication or network broadcast) for Tomatometer consideration. Alternatively, a TV outlet must
                        be broadcasting in one of the top ten DMAs, as listed by Nielsen Ratings. Radio outlets must be
                        broadcasting in one of the top five DMAs, as listed by Arbitron. In almost all cases, an
                        outlet's individual reviews must be available online, either as a segment transcript or an
                        alternate, written review.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Online publications must achieve and maintain a minimum 500,000 unique monthly visitors
                        according to comScore, Inc or Nielsen Net Ratings and reviews must have an average length of at
                        least 300 words. Publications must also show a consistent standard of professionalism, writing
                        quality, and editorial integrity across all reviews and articles. Lastly, site design and layout
                        should also reflect a reasonable level of quality and must have a domain name specific to the
                        property.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For all outlets, reviews should be readable within a standard browser; reviews that require
                        users to download additional software or browser plugins (ie PDFs) are strongly discouraged.
                        Applications for international outlets will be made on a case-by-case basis, with input from
                        local Rotten Tomatoes editors when applicable.
                    </p>

                <h3>CRITICS APPROVAL</h3>

                <div class="m-text">
                    <p>
                        Print critics must be currently employed as a film critic at a Tomatometer-approved publication for a minimum of two calendar years to be considered for individual approval.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Broadcast critics must be currently employed as a film critic at a Tomatometer-approved outlet for a minimum of two calendar years to be considered for individual approval.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Online critics must have published no less than 100 reviews across two calendar years at a single, Tomatometer-approved publication, and all reviews should have an average length of at least 300 words to be considered for individual approval.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In all cases applicants should have two years' worth of published reviews available online, and all applicants must be able to demonstrate that their reviews have editorial oversight.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In some cases, critics that are publishing reviews on a Tomatometer-approved outlet and have membership in select critics associations may be considered for individual approval. However, membership in a critics association does not guarantee approval.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        You have to be followed by at least 1 follower to apply PT Critic
                    </p>
